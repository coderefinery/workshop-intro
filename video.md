# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

## Arrival

Please test the following when arriving:

- Test that you have Git installed: `git --version`
- Check [Git configuration instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup/#configuring-git).


## Welcome

- Software Carpentry style of teaching: code-along and many exercises, minimize slides
- Instructor gives a [tour of Zoom](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/zoom-mechanics.md)
- Announce that Zoom chat can be used for questions but that the content will
  be deleted afterwards.
- We will use a hackmd for questions/notes/links that we want to keep.
- We will neither record the session, nor archive the chat.
- Presentation of instructors and helpers
- Instructor gives a tour of hackmd which contains a list of participants' initials.
- Ice-breaker: ask participants to use their real name on Zoom,
  roll-call for participants to write their name in the hackmd,
  their experience with Git, and their operating system (we will use this information to form groups).
  Instructor writes the first line to show what we
  expect here and also explains how hackpads work.


## Practical issues

- We follow [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
- We want everybody to be comfortable. Please point out problems.
- Certificates available upon request to support@coderefinery.org.
- We understand that screen space is limited. If you have an external screen,
  we recommend to use it but we cannot require it. Although all the material is
  [online](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), we will
  try to not require you to have all the windows open at once.
- We know that video can be tiring and we will take breaks.
- Also for us the situation is new and we may experience hiccups. We are learning as well.


## Join and let others know

- All material is online and CC-BY.
- If you like what we do, sign up for the [CodeRefinery newsletter](https://coderefinery.org/),

- Get notified, or have your friends and colleagues,
  [be notified of other workshops](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/#notify-me).
