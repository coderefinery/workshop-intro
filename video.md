# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops


## Welcome

- Presentation of instructors and helpers.
- Software Carpentry style of teaching: code-along and many exercises, minimize slides.
- Instructor gives a [tour of Zoom](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/zoom-mechanics.md)
- Announce that Zoom chat can be used for questions but that the content will
  be deleted afterwards.
- We clarify to participants whether and how we record and archive and inform participants
  how they can participate while maintaining privacy for them and others.
- We will use a HackMD for questions/notes/links that we want to keep.
- Instructor gives a tour of HackMD which contains a list of participants' initials.
- Ice-breaker to get used to editing HackMD:
    - roll-call for participants to write their name in the HackMD
    - write your experience with Git
    - some tip or trick that you think would benefit someone


## Practical issues

- We follow [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
- We want everybody to be comfortable. Please point out problems.
- We understand that screen space is limited. If you have an external screen,
  we recommend to use it but we cannot require it. Although all the material is
  [online](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), we will
  try to not require you to have all the windows open at once.
- We know that video can be tiring and we will take breaks.
- Also for us the situation is new and we may experience hiccups. We are learning as well.
- Certificates available upon request to support@coderefinery.org.
