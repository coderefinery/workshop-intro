# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Generic welcome

Welcome!


## Privacy note

This workshop may be recorded and streamed.  More about that later: your *video* won't appear, but your *voice* may.


## Presentation of course staff

- **Course staff introduces all of themselves** and what they do
- Check the results of the icebreaker in HackMD
- Icebreaker questions to get used to editing HackMD:
    - write your experience with Git
    - some tip or trick that you think would benefit someone


## About this workshop

### Intended audience

- You've been a researcher for a while, **you code often but your main job isn't coding**. You've never quite learned best practices.
- You work on projects with many people, **but can't really share your code yet because you haven't learned the right tools yet**.
- You are a group leader, and would like your group to work together to get more value out of your code.


### What we cover

- Software Carpentry style of teaching: **code-along and many exercises**, minimize slides.
- Emphasis on version control
- Examples are on GitHub but OK to use another platform instead
- Challenge: different programming languages - when we need an explicit example, we will **default to Python but it's not about Python**.
- We don't aim to just teach you what is in the program. One other goal is to leave you with a personal computer set up to do science independently.

### About the material

- Table of contents: week 1 is mostly **version control**, week 2 is mostly **things made possible by version control**.
- We cover a huge amount of material. We don't expect you to become an expert in everything.
- **Material contains more than we will discuss**.
- We do expect you to learn some very useful things in a few areas, and have a lot of **inspiration for the future**.
- All material is online and CC-BY.


#### Where to find the material

- Material is linked both from workshop page as well as from HackMD.
- All material is online and CC-BY.


## How to ask questions and follow along: HackMD

* **HackMD is our base communication system**:
    * You can **ask questions** at the bottom
    * You can check towards the bottom for a link to our current section
* [HackMD mechanics](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/)
* Anytime, create a new bullet point **at the bottom** to ask a question.  Someone will be watching and respond, and ask the instructor by voice if you want.
* HackMD should contain detailed infromation on exercises and breaks (always at bottom).
* You can also ask questions by voice anytime (but see privacy)


## How to watch and listen: Zoom

- [Zoom mechanics](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/) - you probably know this by now
- Rename yourself to include the breakout room number (based on an email you got), example: **(5) Firstname Lastname**.  You can rename yourself from the participant list.
- **You can indicate status from participant list**: Yes="going well", No="have a problem".  We watch other signals, too.
    - Everyone please indicate "Yes" if you find the "yes" sign.
- We understand that screen space is limited. If you have an external screen, we recommend to use it but we cannot require it. Although all the material is [online](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), we will try to not require you to have all the windows open at once.


## How to watch: Twitch

- If you are watching via Twitch, you can **ask questions via HackMD**.
- We watch twitch chat but HackMD is better.
- You won't go into a breakout room during exercises but we will try to continue interacting in main room.


## Code of Conduct

- Our [Code of Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/) is adapted from [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
- This is a hands-on, interactive workshop.
    - Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
    - If you can't help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.
    - If you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don't suffer silently.
- It's also about the little things:
    - volume
    - font size
    - generally confusing instructor
    - **not enough breaks**


## Breaks

- We will take breaks
- Sessions are often 50 minutes + 10 minute break + 25 minutes + 10 minutes break
- You *should* complain when we go over breaks.


## Privacy

- We stream (twitch.tv) and record the workshop.
- Your video should never appear in either (but, **leave your video off** in the main room anyway)
- Your voice in the main room may be recorded and posted to YouTube
- **Breakout rooms are completely private**
- HackMD is posted on the course page, without names.
- All outputs are CC-BY


## Certificates

- Certificates available upon request to support@coderefinery.org.
