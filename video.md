# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Generic welcome

Welcome!


## Privacy note

* **This workshop may be recorded and streamed.**
* Your *video* won't appear, but your *voice* may.
* Chat and HackMD lets you communicate anonymously.



## About the workshop

There is **science** and there is **computing**.  The computing often
holds back the science, and isn't always taught.

The point is that everyone has the base skills in order to

- Do their science without barriers
- Produce higher quality, reproducible research
- Work together better


### What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools
- Funded by https://neic.no
- Run this workshop, and others like it
- Gitlab at https://source.coderefinery.org


### How the workshop works

- Demos and talking (main room)
- Type-along (main room)
- Exercises (breakout rooms)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

There is a **lot** of material, and everyone will take a slightly
different path.  This is OK!

We have hundreds of people watching this.

You can watch various ways:

- Watch in Zoom
- Watch via livestream
- Watch recordings later


### Who are we?

- Course coordinators
- Instructors
- Expert helpers
- Exercise leaders



### Not everything will be perfect

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.
- Instructors learn as much as you.
- Exercise leaders (breakout rooms) are also learning.
- **If something goes wrong, let someone know.  We will do
  something.** Example: audio, font size, speed, breakout room
  issues.



## Practicalities

### Online, interactive workshop.

- Lectures and type-along
- Breakout rooms
- Teams that stay the same

### Chat and communication

- Please don't use the Zoom chat for questions: who can keep track?
  - But you can for practical questions

- Use HackMD for chat: questions in bullet points:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- From here you can also find important links and reference.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png)

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in HackMD: it is public.**

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in HackMD**

### Zoom

- Rename yourself to include your "Breakout room number", e.g. "(13)
  Richard Darst".
  - Helpers are "(13,H) Richard Darst"

  ![Screenshot of Zoom names as described above](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/zoom--learner-names.png)

- You rename yourself from the participants list:

- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" may be useful (it makes a separate window
  for the screen share, you can hide pictures if you want)

### Screen arrangement

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

- We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.
- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" (in the settings) gives you two *windows*
  which might be useful.

## Care for the community

### Be respectful and helpful

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  We need
everyone to take part in this process.

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?", in breakout rooms.
- **When something isn't going right, *speak (or HackMD) up quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


### Instructors and helpers aren't perfect

- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.


### Code of Conduct

In the worst case, there may be problem with someone.  In that case,
we follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).  We expect
that the above points prevent things from getting to here.



## Final notes

### Privacy

- We stream (twitch.tv) and record the workshop.
- **Leave your video off** in the main room (but we should not capture
  it anyway)
  - We may mute you/turn off your video for you
  - Then you can't turn it on yourself, write **breakout room number**
    in HackMD and someone will come help.
- Your voice in the main room may be recorded and posted to YouTube
- **Breakout rooms are completely private**
- HackMD content will be posted on the course page, without names.
- All outputs are CC-BY
