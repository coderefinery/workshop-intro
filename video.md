# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Generic welcome

Welcome!


## Privacy note

* **This workshop may be recorded and streamed.**
* Your *video* won't appear, but your *voice* may.
* Chat and HackMD lets you communicate anonymously.



## About the workshop

There is **science** and there is **computing**.  The computing often
holds back the science, and isn't taught.

The point is that everyone has the base skills in order to

- Do their science without barriers
- Produce higher quality, reproducible research
- Work together better


### What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools
- Funded by https://neic.no
- Run this workshop, and others like it
- Gitlab at https://source.coderefinery.org


### How the workshop works

- Demos and talking (main room)
- Type-along (main room)
- Exercises (breakout rooms)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

There is a **lot** of material, and everyone will take a slightly
different path.  This is OK!

You can watch various ways:

- Watch in Zoom
- Watch via livestream
- Watch recordings later


### Who are we?

- Course coordinators
- Instructors
- Expert helpers
- Exercise leaders



### Not everything will be perfect

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.
- Instructors learn as much as you.
- Exercise leaders (breakout rooms) are also learning.
- **If something goes wrong, let someone know.  We will do
  something.** Example: audio, font size, speed, breakout room
  issues.



## Practicalities

### Online, interactive workshop.

- Lectures and type-along
- Breakout rooms
- Teams that stay the same

### Chat and communication

- Please don't use the Zoom chat for questions: who can keep track?
  - But you can for practical questions

- Use HackMD for chat: questions in bullet points:

- You can switch between view and edit modes:

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in HackMD: it is public.**

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in HackMD**

### Zoom

- Rename yourself to include your "Breakout room number", e.g. "(13)
  Richard Darst".
- Helpers are "(13,H) Richard Darst"



### Screen arrangement

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

- We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.
- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" (in the settings) gives you two *windows*
  which might be useful.
