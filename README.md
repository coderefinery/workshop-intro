# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

## Arrival

Please test the following when arriving:

- Test that you have Git installed: `git --version`
- Test that you have Python installed: `python --version`
- Verify whether you can use both above commands in the same environment/terminal.
- Check [Git configuration instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup/#configuring-git).

In-person workshops:

- Come on in, please try to sit next to someone, because we do lots of
  group work.


## Welcome

- Few words about the project: https://coderefinery.org sponsored by https://neic.no and partners
- GitLab for Nordic research software: https://source.coderefinery.org
- Presentation of instructors and helpers

In-person workshops:

- Presentation of participants
- Distribute CodeRefinery stickers to attendees

Video workshops:

- Announce that Zoom chat can be used for questions but that the content will
  be deleted afterwards.
- We will use a hackmd for questions/notes/links that we want to keep.
- Ice-breaker: roll-call for participants to write their name in the hackmd,
  contact info if they prefer to share that, one-line what they are working on,
  and their experience with Git. Instructor writes the first line to show what we
  expect here and also explains how hackpads work.


## Who is CodeRefinery for?

- You've been a researcher for a while, you code all the time but
  your main job isn't coding.  You've never quite learned best
  practices.
- You work on projects with many people, but can't really share your
  code yet because you haven't learned the right tools yet.
- You are a group leader, and would like your group to work together
  to get more value out of your code


## Program for the next 3 days

- Emphasis on version control
- Examples are on GitHub but OK to use another platform instead
- Challenge: different programming languages - when we need an explicit example,
  we will default to Python
- Quick look at the program: https://coderefinery.org/workshops/
- We don't aim to just teach you what is in the program. One other goal is to
  leave you with a personal computer set up to do science independently.
- All material is online and CC-BY


## What do we expect you to get out of CodeRefinery?

- We cover a *huge* amount of material.  We don't expect you to become
  an expert in everything.
- We do expect you to learn some *very* useful things *in a few
  areas*, and have a lot of inspiration for the future.

No one is perfect at every project - because not every project
needs perfection.  However, most projects can get a bit better:

- From bunch of files, to tracking code, to sharing code.
- From code that can easily get bugs, to tested code, to automatic
  notification when things break.
- From code which can't be run in five years, to something which can
  be made to run in five years, to something still used in five years.
- From scattered comments, to better readme files, to a dedicated
  documentation site.
- From code which no one can use, to something that is reusable, to
  something that people want to use and improve.


## Interactive style

- Software Carpentry style of teaching: code-along and many exercises, minimize slides
- Sticky notes system (red=request a helper come by, yellow=done with exercise)
- Optional session feedback (one aspect you enjoyed, one aspect we need to improve)
- 6 months feedback


## Practical issues

- We follow The Carpentries Code of Conduct: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html
- We want everybody to be comfortable, please point out problems
- Electricity
- Wireless
- Coffee breaks
- Lunch options (please list on white board or collect in a shared document or discuss map)
- Certificates available upon request to support@coderefinery.org
