# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

- [In-person workshops](in-person.md)
- [Video workshops](video.md)


## Instructor note

There is a lot of material in these pages, and they need to be covered
as quickly as possible.  They are designed (well, video.md so far), so
that you can just emphasize the bold text.  Many other things are
covered in other preparation documents that learners should have
seen.  Read these before you give the intro, so that you can avoid
repetition.
