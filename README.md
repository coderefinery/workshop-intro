# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

## Arrival

Please test the following when arriving:

- Test that you have Git installed: `git --version`
- Test that you have Python installed: `python --version`
- Verify whether you can use both above commands in the same environment/terminal.
- Check [Git configuration instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup/#configuring-git).

In-person workshops:

- Come on in, please try to sit next to someone, because we do lots of
  group work.


## Who is CodeRefinery for?

- You've been a researcher for a while, you code all the time but
  your main job isn't coding.  You've never quite learned best
  practices.
- You work on projects with many people, but can't really share your
  code yet because you haven't learned the right tools yet.
- You are a group leader, and would like your group to work together
  to get more value out of your code

The CodeRefinery project:

- Few words about the project: https://coderefinery.org sponsored by https://neic.no and partners
- GitLab for Nordic research software: https://source.coderefinery.org


## Welcome

- Presentation of instructors and helpers

In-person workshops:

- Presentation of participants
- Distribute CodeRefinery stickers to attendees

Video workshops:

- Announce that Zoom chat can be used for questions but that the content will
  be deleted afterwards.
- We will use a hackmd for questions/notes/links that we want to keep.
- Ice-breaker: ask participants to use their real name on Zoom,
  roll-call for participants to write their name in the hackmd,
  contact info if they like, one-line what they are working on,
  their experience with Git, and their operating system (we will use this information to form groups).
  Instructor writes the first line to show what we
  expect here and also explains how hackpads work.


## Program for the workshop

- Emphasis on version control
- Examples are on GitHub but OK to use another platform instead
- Challenge: different programming languages - when we need an explicit example,
  we will default to Python
- Quick look at the program: https://coderefinery.org/workshops/
- We don't aim to just teach you what is in the program. One other goal is to
  leave you with a personal computer set up to do science independently.
- All material is online and CC-BY


## What do we expect you to get out of CodeRefinery?

- We cover a *huge* amount of material.  We don't expect you to become
  an expert in everything.
- We do expect you to learn some *very* useful things *in a few
  areas*, and have a lot of inspiration for the future.

No one is perfect at every project - because not every project
needs perfection.  However, most projects can get a bit better:

- From bunch of files, to tracking code, to sharing code.
- From code that can easily get bugs, to tested code, to automatic
  notification when things break.
- From code which can't be run in five years, to something which can
  be made to run in five years, to something still used in five years.
- From scattered comments, to better readme files, to a dedicated
  documentation site.
- From code which no one can use, to something that is reusable, to
  something that people want to use and improve.


## Interactive style

- Software Carpentry style of teaching: code-along and many exercises, minimize slides

- **In-person workshops**: Sticky notes system (red=request a helper come by, yellow=done with exercise)
- **Video workshops**: "no" means technical problem or got stuck, "yes" means done with exercise, "raise hand" means question.
  We try these non-verbal signals out in an ice-breaker.


## Feedback

Optional session feedback (one aspect you enjoyed, one aspect we need to improve):

- **In-person workshops**: On sticky notes
- **Video workshops**: In the collaborative note (hackmd)

6 months feedback:

- 5-minute survey 3-6 months after the event


## Practical issues

- We follow The Carpentries Code of Conduct: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html
- We want everybody to be comfortable, please point out problems
- Certificates available upon request to support@coderefinery.org

Checklist for in-person workshops:

- Electricity
- Wireless
- Coffee breaks
- Lunch options (please list on white board or collect in a shared document or discuss map)

Video workshops:

- We understand that screen space is limited. If you have an external screen,
  we recommend to use it but we cannot require it. Although all the material is
  [online](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), we will
  try to not require you to have all the windows open at once.
- We know that video can be tiring and we will take breaks.
- No problem if you need to leave the screen but please signal it with the "clock" symbol.
- Also for us the situation is new and we may experience hiccups. We are learning as well.
