# Welcome to day 2 of the CodeRefinery workshop

## Recap of day 1 - Introduction to version control

We learned about (intentionally using git terminology here for you to check that you are ready for the next day (=understand the terms used):
- [Motivation for version control and what it is](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/motivation/)
- [Cloning and forking repositories](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/browsing/)
- [Commiting changes](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/)
- [Pull requests](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/)

## For newcomers
### How the workshop works

This is a livestreamed workshop! 

Everyone will watch the livestream of instructors talking and showing demos on Twitch. 

In week 1, there will also be exercises, which you can do in two ways: on your own or in team. 

No dedicated (team) exercise time in week 2, but interaction via collaborative document. 

We plan on having a minimum 10 min break every hour.

### Collaborative document

Even though this is a livestream workshop, you are never alone, we use a collaborative doument as our connection to you. We use it:

- to distribute information to you.

- as a "chat":
  - let us know about accessibility issues
  - ask questions , it is anonymous!
    
  ![Example questions in collaborative document](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- Please don't use the Twitch chat for questions about the content!

### Materials

You can find all the materials linked from the [workshop page](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/).
These materials will also be available after the workshop and you may use and reuse them as you like under CC-BY license.

### Recordings

You can find unedited recordings on Twitch for some days. 
With about one day delay, you can then also find edited recordings, with tags to easily jump to specific tags on the [CodeRefinery youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47aupE7HKGduAjXKt1Gwrg).
