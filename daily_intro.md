# Welcome to day 2 of the CodeRefinery workshop

## Recap of day 1 - Introduction to version control

We learned about (intentionally using git terminology here for you to check that you are ready for the next day (=understand the terms used):
- [Motivation for version control and what it is](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/motivation/)
- [Cloning and forking repositories](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/browsing/)
- [Commiting changes](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/)
- [Pull requests](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/)

## What is coming on day 2

For day 2, we'll move to local work. To follow along for day 2, you need a local VS Code installation or command line terminal set up. See the [install instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). However, many parts can also be done through the GitHub web interface still. 

In reaction to your comments in the feedback yesterday, we now also have an **RStudio track** for Day 2 :)

# Welcome to day 3 of the CodeRefinery workshop

## Recap of day 1+2 - Introduction to version control

We learned about **version control**, how to do **commits**, **clone and fork repositories**, about **branches** and how they can be **merged**. 
We also learned about how to move from working in the GitHub webinterface to your local environment and work with git on the command line/VSCode/RStudio.

## What is coming on day 3 

For day 3, we'll learn about how to collaborate with others or yourself using git: **[Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)**.
- It builds on things from days 1 and 2, be prepared to look for info from previous days materials, but if you know the basic concepts of git, you will be well preapared to follow too. 
- For the hands-on exercises we assume that you can link to and push/pull from GitHub.  You need to make sure the authentication works with whatever program you are using: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/
-> However, it is also possible to do everything in GitHub webinterface.

Today it all comes together, this also means that it might be harder to follow if you just now learned about version control. Don't give up, try to follow as you can and come back and review as necessary.


## For newcomers
### How the workshop works

This is a livestreamed workshop! 

**Everyone will watch the livestream** of instructors talking and showing demos on Twitch. 

In week 1, there will also be **exercises**, which you can do in two ways: on your own or in team. 

No dedicated (team) exercise time in week 2, but interaction via collaborative document. 

We plan on having a minimum **10 min break every hour**.

### Collaborative document

Even though this is a livestream workshop, you are never alone, we use the **collaborative document** as our connection to you. 

We use it:

- to distribute information to you.
- as a "chat":
  - let us know about accessibility issues
  - ask questions , it is anonymous!
    
  ![Example questions in collaborative document](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

Please don't put any names or other identifying information in the document!
