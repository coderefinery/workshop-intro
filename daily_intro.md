# Welcome to day 2 of the CodeRefinery workshop

## Recap of day 1 - Introduction to version control

We learned about (intentionally using git terminology here for you to check that you are ready for the next day (=understand the terms used):
- [Motivation for version control and what it is](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/motivation/)
- [Cloning and forking repositories](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/browsing/)
- [Commiting changes](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/)
- [Pull requests](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/merging/)

## What is coming on day 2

For day 2, we'll move to local work. To follow along for day 2, you need a local VS Code installation or command line terminal set up. See the [install instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). However, many parts can also be done through the GitHub web interface still. 

In reaction to your comments in the feedback yesterday, we now also have an **RStudio track** for Day 2 :) 

## For newcomers
### How the workshop works

This is a livestreamed workshop! 

**Everyone will watch the livestream** of instructors talking and showing demos on Twitch. 

In week 1, there will also be **exercises**, which you can do in two ways: on your own or in team. 

No dedicated (team) exercise time in week 2, but interaction via collaborative document. 

We plan on having a minimum **10 min break every hour**.

### Collaborative document

Even though this is a livestream workshop, you are never alone, we use the **collaborative document** as our connection to you. 

We use it:

- to distribute information to you.
- as a "chat":
  - let us know about accessibility issues
  - ask questions , it is anonymous!
    
  ![Example questions in collaborative document](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

Please don't put any names or other identifying information in the document!

### Lesson materials

### Recordings

You can find unedited recordings on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery) for some days. 
With about one day delay, you can then also find edited recordings, with tags to easily jump to specific sections of the lesson on the [CodeRefinery youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47aupE7HKGduAjXKt1Gwrg).
