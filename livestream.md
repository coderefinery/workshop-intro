## Welcome everyone!


## Why are we here?

CodeRefinery is an addition to general coding classes, supporting you to make your code more reproducible.

## What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools, funded by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (https://neic.no)
- Runs this workshop, and others like it
- Community of research software enthusiasts

**[https://coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org)**

CodeRefinery is a **partnership** of Aalto university (FI),
CSC - IT Center for Science (FI), Center for Humanities Computing (DK), 
Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DK),
EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden (ENCCS) (SE), National Academic Infrastructure for Super­computing in Sweden (NAISS) (SE) and NRIS/Sigma2 (NO).

## Practical matters: how to attend

### How the workshop works

This is a livestreamed workshop! 

**Everyone will watch the livestream** of instructors talking and showing demos on Twitch. 

In week 1, there will also be exercises, which you can do in two ways: on your own or in team. 

No dedicated (team) exercise time in week 2, but interaction via collaborative document. 

We plan on having a **minimum 10 min break every hour**.

The materials are **always available for everyone**, and linked from the Workshop page. 

All **recordings** will be available on twitch right away and on youtube the day after. 

### Collaborative Document

Even though this is a livestream workshop, you are never alone, we use a collaborative document as our **connection to you**. 
We use it:

- to **distribute information** to you.

- as a "chat":
  - let us know about **accessibility issues**
  - **ask questions**
  - Note: It is anonymous!
    
  ![Example questions in collaborative document](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- Please don't use the Twitch chat for questions about the content!

#### Collaborative document usage

You can switch between view and edit modes:
![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png)

- You might have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you can go back to view)
- Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

**Hands-on for all: Collaborative document and icebreaker**

## Practical setup for the workshop

### Own course directory

We suggest to create a directory/folder for this course on your computer, where you can store all exercise materials etc., to make it easy to clean up later.  

### Screen arrangement

This workshop provides many things to keep track of. We suggest: 

We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for your own work.

space on the other](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/layout--learner-livestream-sidebyside-onebrowser.png)

### Where to focus?

There is so much information!  

1. **Livestream** - first priority
2. **Collaborative document** - to find info or post questions and find answers
3. **Lesson material webpage** (as needed)

## Things that can (and will) go wrong

### There are major accessibility problems
- e.g. audio quality is bad, screen not visible, breaks not coming, unintelligble explanation...
- Write the problem in the bottom of the collaborative document immediately.

### An instructor/team leader makes a mistake
- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.

### You get overloaded with information
- Don't worry!
- Change to passive watching and re-watch or read about unclear topics later.
- Use our bring your own code session to ask questions weeks after the workshop.

### Collaborative document is too fast to follow
- Don't follow it.  It will be published for future reference.
- Write your question and come back to it later.

### We can't solve your problems in the collaborative document
- We can answer many questions and give hints, but can't solve
  everything
- Some things are best solved by someone seeing your screen.
- Change your watching style and try to work it out later.
- **We recommend to ask your local IT support for technical questions or join our "bring your own code" sessions (see schedule!)**

### We deviate from the schedule
- We try to stay on track, but sometimes things do not go as planned and we have to leave out some (sub-)topic.

### Collaborative document lags and you can't edit / text goes wrong
- This sometimes happens with high load
- Everyone: Switch to "view mode" and wait for it to calm down.
- Wait a moment, workshop staff will move older content to archive, to lower the load.

### The stream suddenly dies
- Broadcaster's computer has crashed.
- Stay around and it will resume in about 5 minutes.

### You don't yet have some important software installed or configured
- Oops... but it's OK
- Switch to "watching" mode and work on fixing it for the next day.
- Check [installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/) to see what may be missing.

### You can't attend every day
- Attend only the parts you are interested in 
- Materials are always available
- Video availability right away on Twitch, next day on YouTube

### A cat visits one of the instructors
- <3

### The course is too cool and you want to know more
- Check out hints in the workshop-outro
- Join as a team leader next time
- Advertise to your organization to become a partner

## Who is here today?

- About 10 course coordinators, instructors and facilitators
  - Many are **Research Software Engineers** (more on this in the courses outro; but you may already check out [Nordic-RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/))
- Over 300 registered participants from over 20 different countries 
- Learners from all levels and backgrounds

## Be respectful and helpful

If you know some of the material already, please help answering questions on the collaborative document.

Some things to keep in mind:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **When something isn't going right, *use the collaborative document to let us know quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".

## Code of Conduct

In the worst case, there may be a problem with someone (instructor or fellow learner).  In that case,
we follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
