# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Generic welcome

Hello everyone.


## Why are we here?

**These days, computation is everywhere.**  Many people learn programming,
but it's much harder to learn how all of the things fit together in
practice.

This means that computing often holds back the science, and not
everyone has an equal opportunity.

The point is that everyone has to have base skills in order to:

- Do their science without barriers
- Produce higher quality, reproducible research
- Collaborate


### What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools, funded by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (https://neic.no)
- Runs this workshop, and others like it
- Gitlab service at https://source.coderefinery.org

CodeRefinery is a partnership of ENCCS (SE), CSC (FI), DeiC (DK),
UNINETT Sigma2 (NO), SNIC (SE), Type 1 Consortium for Interactive HPC
(DK), and USIT, UiO (NO), and Aalto University (FI).


### Who are we?

- Course coordinators
- Instructors
- Expert helpers
- Exercise leaders

Introductions?  ... happen during icebreakers and before each lesson.



## Practical matters: how to attend


### How the workshop works

When some people teach online, they can reach ~20 people at once.  We
can reach hundreds.

You can watch various ways:

- Livestream - anyone!
- Livestream, separate Zoom for exercises and discussion
- Livestream, in-person meetups for exercises and discussion

There are many parts of the workshop (*this will all make sense soon*):

- Demos and talking (livestream)
- Type-along (livestream)
- Exercises sessons (alone or in teams)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

There is a **lot** of material, and everyone will take a slightly
different path.  This is OK!


### Screen arrangement

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

* We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.

space on the other](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/layout--learner-livestream-sidebyside-onebrowser.png)


### Chat and communication

The **Notes Doc** is a collaborative document tool.

- We use a collab doc to distribute information to you.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png)

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Use the Notes for "chat": questions in bullet points:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- Instructors and helpers watch and answer (by writing or on-stream).

- **Do not include names or identifies in the Notes Doc: it is public.**

- Please don't use the Twitch or Zoom chat for questions about the content: who can keep
  track?

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in the Notes**


### Where do you focus?

There is so much information!  What should we look?

1. **Livestream** - first priority
2. **Your team** - if you have one
3. **Your own type-along** - when you can
5. **Lesson material webpage** (as needed)
4. **Notes** - to find info or do Q&A

<!--
### If you are only in the livestream

- Watch and exercises yourself as you would like!

### If you are in an in-person room

- Watch the stream together, during exercises, work together.

### If you are in Zoom for exercises

- You switch between the livestream and Zoom.  **We make it clear.**

- Who to ask for help: Zoom host or Notes

- You can join Zoom breakout rooms yourself, use the "breakout rooms"
  button.  "Leave meeting" also allows you to return to the main room.

  - If you can't, use chat to ask for help.

- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" may be useful (it makes a separate window
  for the screen share, you can hide pictures if you want)
-->
<!--

- If you need help moving to a breakout room:

  - Rename yourself to include your "Breakout room number", e.g. "(13)
    Richard Darst".
    - Helpers are "(13,H) Richard Darst"

    ![Screenshot of Zoom names as described above](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/zoom--learner-names.png)

  - You rename yourself from the participants list:

## Care for the community

### Not everything will be perfect

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.
- This is a live production, not curated
- We adjust to what each particular audience wants


### Instructors and helpers aren't perfect

- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.


### Be respectful and helpful

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  We need
everyone to take part in this process.

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?" in your teams.
- **When something isn't going right, *speak (or Notes Doc) up quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


### Code of Conduct

In the worst case, there may be problem with someone.  In that case,
we follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).  We expect
that the above points prevent things from getting to here.




## Things that can (and will) go wrong

### You get overloaded with information
- Don't worry!
- Change your watching style and know material will be available for you to watch later.
- Instant video replays help here, but the material is also open.

### Notes doc is too fast to follow
- Don't follow it.  It's published for future reference.
- Only look at the bottom during the sessions.  Review later.
- Write your question and come back to it later.

### We can't solve your problems in the Notes doc
- We can many questions and give hints, but can't solve
  everything
- Some things are best solved by someone seeing your screen.
- Switch your watching style and try to work it out later.
- **We recommend you have local support.  Partners have local
  support.  It might be wise to have someone around to ask.**

### We don't have time to cover everything
- This is just a fact - sorry.
- Lessons are designed with extra material for later study.
- You are encouraged to review later.
- Talk with collaborators and make your own study network.

### We deviate from the schedule
- We try to stay on track, but make choices depending each course.

### Notes lag and you can't edit / text goes wrong
- This sometimes happens with high load
- We recently upgraded but it could still happen.
- Everyone: Switch to "view mode" and wait for it to calm down.
- The real solution is that we (the staff) need to keep it shorter -
  we will move older data to an "archive Notes doc".

### There are major accessibility problems
- e.g. audio quality is bad, screen not visible, breaks not coming, unintelligble explanation...
- Write the problem in the bottom of the Notes immediately.

### The stream suddenly dies
- Broadcaster's computer has crashed.
- Stay around and it will resume in about 5 minutes.

### You don't yet have some important software installed or configured
- Oops... but it's OK
- Switch to "watching" mode and work on fixing it for the next day.
- Ask for help if needed
- Check installation instructions to see what may be missing.

### You can't attend every day
- Review material later, raw Twitch video delay is about zero minutes.

### A cat visits one of the instructors
- How is this a problem?
- CATS visiting is one of the highlights of the day.

### The course is too cool and you want to know more
- Check out hints in the workshop-outro
- Join as a team leader next time
- Ask your local supporters
