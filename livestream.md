# CodeRefinery: Welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Welcome everyone!


## Why are we here?

![6 helpful steps towards reproducible research, by Heidi Seibold](https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya/status/1579385587865649153/photo/1)

**These days, computation is everywhere.**  Many people learn programming,
but it's much harder to learn how all of the things fit together in
practice.

This means that computing often holds back the Science, and not
everyone has an equal opportunity.

The point is that everyone has to have basic computing skills in order to:

- Do their science without barriers
- Produce higher quality, reproducible research
- Collaborate


## What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools, funded by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (https://neic.no)
- Runs this workshop, and others like it
- Community of FAIR research software enthusiasts

CodeRefinery is a partnership of Aalto university (FI),
CSC - IT Center for Science (FI), Center for Humanities Computing (DK), 
Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DK),
EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden  (SE), National Academic Infrastructure for Super­computing in Sweden (NAISS) (SE) and NRIS/Sigma2 (NO).

## Who is here today?

~ 10
- Course coordinators
- Instructors
- Expert helpers

~ 6 exercise leaders

~ 200 participants from ~ 25 different countries

Introductions?  ...during icebreakers and before each lesson.


## Practical matters: how to attend

### How the workshop works

This is a livestreamed workshop! 
Everyone will watch the livestream on Twitch. In week 1, there will also be exercises, which you can do in various ways: 

![Ways of attending a CodeRefinery workshop , exercise sessions](img/exercise_options.png)

No dedicated team exercise time in week 2, but interaction via collaborative document. 

There are many parts of the workshop:

- Demos, type-along and talking (livestream)
- Exercises sessons (alone or in teams), only week 1
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

The materials are always available for everyone, and linked from the Workshop page. 
All recordings will be available on twitch right away and on youtube the day after. 

### Collaborative Document

The collaborative doument is our connection to you. We use it:

- to distribute information to you.

- as a "chat":
  - let us know about accessibility issues
  - ask questions, get answers 
  ![Example questions in collaborative document](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- Please don't use the Twitch chat for questions about the content!

#### Collaborative document usage

You can switch between view and edit modes:
![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png)

- You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you can go back to view)
- Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- **Do not include names or identifiers in the document: it is public.**

**Hands-on for all: Collaborative document and icebreaker**


## Setup for the workshop

### Screen arrangement

A suggestion...

We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for your own work.

![Example screen arrangement with broadcast on one side and learner
space on the other](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/layout--learner-livestream-sidebyside-onebrowser.png)

### Own course directory

We suggest to create a directory/folder for this course on your computer, where you can store all exercise materials etc., to make it easy to clean up later.  

### Where to focus?

There is so much information!  

1. **Livestream** - first priority
2. **Your team** - if you have one
3. **Your own type-along** - when you can
5. **Lesson material webpage** (as needed)
4. **Collaborative document** - to find info or do Q&A


## Care for the community

### Not everything will be perfect

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.
- This is a live production, not curated

-> Use the collaborative document

### Instructors and helpers aren't perfect

- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.

### Be respectful and helpful

Four pieces of advice:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?" in your teams.
- **When something isn't going right, *use the collaborative document to let us know quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


### Code of Conduct

In the worst case, there may be problem with someone.  In that case,
we follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).  


## Things that can (and will) go wrong

### You get overloaded with information
- Don't worry!
- Change your watching style and know material will be available for you to watch later.
- Instant video replays help here, but the material is also open.

### Collaborative document is too fast to follow
- Don't follow it.  It will be published for future reference.
- Only look at the bottom during the sessions.  Review later.
- Write your question and come back to it later.

### We can't solve your problems in the collaborative document
- We can answer many questions and give hints, but can't solve
  everything
- Some things are best solved by someone seeing your screen.
- Switch your watching style and try to work it out later.
- **We recommend you have local support.  Partners have local
  support.  It might be wise to have someone around to ask.**

### We don't have time to cover everything
- This is just a fact - sorry.
- Lessons are designed with extra material for later study.
- You are encouraged to review later.
- Talk with collaborators and make your own study network.

### We deviate from the schedule
- We try to stay on track, but make choices depending each course.

### Collaborative document lags and you can't edit / text goes wrong
- This sometimes happens with high load
- We recently upgraded but it could still happen.
- Everyone: Switch to "view mode" and wait for it to calm down.
- The real solution is that we (the staff) need to keep it shorter -
  we will move older data to an "archive Notes doc".

### There are major accessibility problems
- e.g. audio quality is bad, screen not visible, breaks not coming, unintelligble explanation...
- Write the problem in the bottom of the collaborative document immediately.

### The stream suddenly dies
- Broadcaster's computer has crashed.
- Stay around and it will resume in about 5 minutes.

### You don't yet have some important software installed or configured
- Oops... but it's OK
- Switch to "watching" mode and work on fixing it for the next day.
- Ask for help if needed
- Check installation instructions to see what may be missing.

### You can't attend every day
- Attend only the parts you are interested in 
- Materials are always available
- Video availability right away on Twitch, next day on YouTube

### A cat visits one of the instructors
- <3

### The course is too cool and you want to know more
- Check out hints in the workshop-outro
- Join as a team leader next time
- Advertise to your organization to become a partner
