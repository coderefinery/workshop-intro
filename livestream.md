# CodeRefinery: welcome and practical information for workshops

---

## Generic welcome

Welcome!


## About the workshop

These days, computation is everywhere.  Many people learn programming,
but it's much harder to learn how all of the things fit together in
practice.

This means that computing often holds back the science, and not
everyone has an equal opportunity.

The point is that everyone has to have base skills in order to:

- Do their science without barriers
- Produce higher quality, reproducible research
- Collaborate


### What is CodeRefinery

- Nordic project to teach basic scientific computing tools
- Funded by https://neic.no
- Run this workshop, and others like it
- Gitlab at https://source.coderefinery.org

CodeRefinery is a partnership of ENCCS (SE), CSC (FI), DeiC (DK),
UNINETT Sigma2 (NO), SNIC (SE), Type 1 Consortium for Interactive HPC
(DK), and USIT, UiO (NO).


### Who are we?

- Course coordinators
- Instructors
- Expert helpers
- Exercise leaders

Introductions?  ... we probably won't have time.


### Not everything will be perfect

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.



## Practicalities


### How the workshop works

When some people teach online, they can reach ~20 people at once.  We
can reach hundreds.

You can watch various ways:

- Livestream - anyone!
- Livestream, separate Zoom for exercises and discussion
- Livestream, some in-person meetups for exercises and discussion

There are many parts of the workshop (*this will all make sense soon*):

- Demos and talking (main room)
- Type-along (main room)
- Exercises (breakout rooms)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

There is a **lot** of material, and everyone will take a slightly
different path.  This is OK!


### Chat and communication

- Use HackMD for chat: questions in bullet points:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--questions2.png)

- From here you can also find important links and reference.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:
  ![View and edit modes at top](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/hackmd--controls.png)

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in HackMD: it is public.**

- Please don't use the Zoom chat for questions: who can keep track?
  - But you can for practical questions, if you are in Zoom.

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in HackMD**

### Where do you focus?

There is so much information!  What should we look?

- **Livestream**
- **Your own type-along**
- **HackMD (all important links should be pasted here)**
  - Only look at the bottom.
  - Come back and read detailed answers later, not during.
- Lesson webpage (as needed, direct links in HackMD)


### Screen arrangement

It really helps to arrange your screen well

- We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.

### If you are only in the livestream

- Watch and exercises yourself as you would like!

### If you are in an in-person room

- Watch the stream together, during exercises, work together.


### If you are in Zoom for exercises

- You switch between the livestream and Zoom.  **We make it clear.**

- Who to ask for help: Zoom host or HackMD

- You can join Zoom breakout rooms yourself, use the "breakout rooms"
  button.  "Leave meeting" also allows you to return to the main room.

  - If you can't, use chat to ask for help.

- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" may be useful (it makes a separate window
  for the screen share, you can hide pictures if you want)

<!--

- If you need help moving to a breakout room:

  - Rename yourself to include your "Breakout room number", e.g. "(13)
    Richard Darst".
    - Helpers are "(13,H) Richard Darst"

    ![Screenshot of Zoom names as described above](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/zoom--learner-names.png)

  - You rename yourself from the participants list:

## Care for the community

### This is a live production, not curated

- The "schedule" is more of a goal than a schedule
- We adjust to what each particular audience wants
- Every workshop is unique and we try to make it exciting.


### Instructors and helpers aren't perfect

- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.


### Be respectful and helpful

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  We need
everyone to take part in this process.

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?", in breakout rooms.
- **When something isn't going right, *speak (or HackMD) up quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


### Code of Conduct

In the worst case, there may be problem with someone.  In that case,
we follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).  We expect
that the above points prevent things from getting to here.
